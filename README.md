# Restaurant Website Project

## About Project

This project is a restaurant website, built using Node.js and EJS for server-side rendering. The website provides various features such as displaying the menu, showing details of each dish, and searching for dishes. 

The website's user interface is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic. It includes a top bar with contact information and language options, a header with navigation links, and a footer with copyright information and credits. 

The website uses several third-party libraries for styling and functionality, including Bootstrap for responsive design, Animate.css for animations, AOS for scroll animations, GLightbox for lightbox effects, Isotope Layout for filtering and sorting layouts, and Swiper for modern mobile touch sliders.

The project structure is well-organized, with separate EJS templates for different views such as the home page, dish details, ingredients, and search results. The static assets like images and stylesheets are stored in the [``public``]directory, and the server-side JavaScript code is in [``app.js``].

The website also uses a SQL database for storing and retrieving data about the restaurant's menu and ingredients. The SQL scripts for creating the database and inserting data are included in the project.
